# Colorful Turtle Drawing

This is a Python program that uses the `turtle` module to draw colorful concentric circles with random colors. The circles are drawn with varying rotation angles, creating a beautiful and dynamic pattern.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need to have Python installed on your machine. The `turtle` module is included by default with Python, so no additional installation is required.

## Setup

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that Python is installed on your computer.
3. Run the Python script to see the drawing in action.

## How it Works

1. The program uses the `turtle` graphics library to draw shapes on a screen.
2. It generates random RGB colors for each circle.
3. The turtle draws multiple circles, each time changing the color and rotating slightly to create a spiral effect.
4. The window background is set to black, and the turtleâ€™s drawing speed is set to the maximum to ensure fast execution.

## Instructions

1. Run the Python script `main.py` 
2. Watch the turtle draw a pattern of concentric circles with random colors.
3. The drawing continues until all circles are drawn, and the program ends.
